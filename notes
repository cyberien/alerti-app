Alerts: 
x Not sure if the 10% color vibe is working

Badges: 
x .badge-light-soft is broken...the color is way too light
- Soft badges should maybe just used the darkened color the way that alerts do?

Breadcrumbs: 
- Should have a .breadcrumb-#{color} version? I only really want the primary/dark/white/light versions?

Button groups:
- Have that dumb focus state, but so does every other theme?
- The .btn-group-vertical is rounded wrong, but I think if I update BS library it will fix
