Alerts: 
- Not sure if the 10% color vibe is working

Badges: 
- .badge-light-soft is broken...the color is way too light
- Soft badges should maybe just used the darkened color the way that alerts do?

Breadcrumbs: 
- Should have a .breadcrumb-#{color} version? I only really want the primary/dark/white/light versions?
